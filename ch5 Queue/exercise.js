// 1. Modify the Queue class to create a Deque class. A deque is a queue-like structure that allows elements to
// be added and removed from both the front and the back of the list. Test your class in a program.
var Queue = require('./queue');


// 2. Use the Deque class you created in Example 5-1 to determine if a given word is a palindrome.


// 3. Modify the priority queue example from Example 5-5 so that the higher-priority elements have higher numbers
// rather than lower numbers. Test your implementa‐ tion with the example in the chapter.


// 4. Modify the ED example (Example 5-5) so the user can control the activity in the ED. Create a menu system that
// allows the user to choose from the following activ‐ ities:
//     a. Patient enters ED.
//     b. Patient is seen by doctor.
//     c. Display list of patients waiting to be seen.
