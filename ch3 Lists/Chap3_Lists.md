### Abstract Data Type (ADT) 

benefits of iterating through a list:
• Not having to worry about the underlying data storage structure when accessing list elements
• Being able to update the list and not having to update the iterator, where an index becomes invalid when a new element is added to the list
• Providing a uniform means of accessing elements for different types of data stores used in the implemenation of a List class
